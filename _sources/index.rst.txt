DelphiFMX
=========

DelphiFMX is a Python binding of Delphi Programming language's multi-patform GUI 
framework - Firemonkey (FMX). FMX is built to support multi-patform application development. 
FMX has the common API to consume any of the platform (Windows, Linux, Android, Mac OSX, IOS) controls. 
As part of the DelphiFMX python package, we compiled FMX for various platforms as a Python extension 
module and provide them as platform-specific PIP wheels.It supports High DPI and custom styling to 
give your applications a great look and feel. You can build both 32-bit and 64-bit applications using 
DelphiFMX. Check out the :doc:`installation </installation>` section to install the DelphiFMX Python 
package and give it a try.
