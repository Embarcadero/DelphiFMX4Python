Delphi's FireMonkey framework as a Python module for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Android GUI development.

FireMonkey is a GUI framework originally from [Embarcadero Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) for native cross-platform application development. It uses the GPU via DirectX or OpenGL for hardware accellerated rendering. It includes a rich styling system and is user extensible. 

<b>About:</b>

The `delphifmx` is a natively compiled Python module powered by the [Python4Delphi library](https://github.com/pyscripter/python4delphi). It gives Python developers access to the FireMonkey GUI framework from Python with no need to use Delphi in their development process, and is [freely redistributable](https://github.com/Embarcadero/DelphiFMX4Python/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
